    <h2>U.S. Shelter Information</h2>
    <p>There are an estimated 3.1 million dogs in U.S. animal shelters every year and aproximatly 390,000 dogs are euthanized each year. 
        Both these numbers have declined from 2011 to 2019 and the percentage of no-kill shelters have more than doubled from 2016 to 2022. 
        Only 5 states account for 50% of animals euthanized and they are: California, Florida, Georgia, Texas, and North Carolina. In 2023 
        1.5 million dogs were adopted.</p>
    <h2>Benefits of Having a Dog</h2>
    <p>There are numerous bennifits of having a dog. Dogs are known to help with social isolation, loneliness, reducing stress, recovering 
        from a crisis and encouraging movement. A lower risk of death in dog owners was found in a review of studies published between 1950 
        and 2019. Dog owners have been found to have lower blood pressure levels and reduced stress that also contribute to this finding.</p>
